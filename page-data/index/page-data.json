My primary technology is Angular, secondary is React. For both I use Typescript. I also often engaged in UI/UX development, where UX I personally found extremely important for Web Development in general. I have reach experience in organizing a proper architecture for optimized and performant SPAs, writing integration tests (I prefer Cypress for this). Reliability and testability of the application are key factors for me. Beside that in the past I did have experience with AngularJS, VueJS, Backbone, and of course JQuery. I also familiar with various other stuff like NestJS, GatsbyJS, NextJS, Ionic Framework. I do love to participate in various IT events, Meetups and Hackathons.","and_sure":"And sure","keywords":"Keywords","notfound.header":"NOT FOUND","notfound.description":"You just hit a route that doesn't exist... the sadness."},"routed":false,"originalPath":"/","redirect":false,"defaultLanguage":"en"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1869473103","3843265564"]}
